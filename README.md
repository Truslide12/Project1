- Search for local events (e.g. Food, Clubbing, Tourist Funs)

APP Walk-Through:
1) A map of the United States (with a search button on the side)
2) User is required to type in a region area in search input or select an area on the map 
3) Then the user will move on to the category drop down box to select the events they want to do 
4) Once the user selects a category, all the event for that category will be displayed on the side 
5) User can scroll to see which will interest them, once they’ve decided, they can click on the event and that event will automatically added to User’s To-do list
6) User will be able to remove the event from the To-do list if they no longer interested
